# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given. You can contribute in the ways listed below.

## Report Bugs

Report bugs using GitHub issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Fix Bugs and Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs and features. Anything tagged with "bug", "help
wanted" or "enhancement" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Write Documentation

The ORCESTRA book could always use more documentation, whether through describing a
a sub-campaign or an instrument measurement or by adding a data processing example.
Please feel free to add information yourself or open an issue if you lack the time 
or knowledge to add it right away.


## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up the `ORCESTRA book` for local development.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv, e.g., using `conda`: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
4. Create a branch for local development and make changes locally.
5. Build the book locally to see if the fully-rendered HTML version looks as intended (see below how to).
6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub.
7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

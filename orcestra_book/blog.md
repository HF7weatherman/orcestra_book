Five days until ORCESTRA

Today I landed in Mindelo, Sao Vicente, Cape Verde. It was a small airport - only two planes on the air field. The landscape is hilly, very brown, a few bushes along the way, but the ocean turquoise and very clear. „Reminds me of Dune, the movie. Do you know it?“, said one colleague from the MPI of chemistry, who also landed with the same plane today. Yes, this place is the closest thing to a desert I've ever been to. The air smells slightly like dust and fumes from the vehicles… It is hot and humid. Even the locals suffer, as the temperature today is above several degrees of what they are used too.

Five days until the first research flight. And we are encountering some hiccups. The colleagues from TU Delft arrived with the other plane which landed today. Their instruments haven’t arrived yet — stuck somewhere in air freight. But we have other bits and pieces which did not arrive yet. Several shipments via air freight are stuck somewhere - not being picked up. The way by surface/ over sea is nit much easier it seems. On top, five containers - three with scientific equipment and two with provisions for the research vessel itself - were stuck on Las Palmas until today. Finally, they departed today. The timing is still tight, but they bring food (in addition to lasers) and we likely won’t leave without them. RV METEOR should arrive as planned - but the ship with the remaining containers will do a pitstop on Praia first before coming to Mindelo. It seems like a slight delay of the departure is unavoidable.

On the positive sight, work around SEA-POL progressed smoothly. The US colleagues already arrived a few days ago, eager to built and set-up the huge radar - reminding me of a big (old-fashioned) football… all white. They didn’t seem to be encountered big difficulties and were already getting into detailed work - like fastening over 600 bolts to the panels of the radar dome.

A slight wind breeze coming from the west brings coolness and ocean smell into the harbour.
It’s time to end the day with the harbour view on the hotel rooftop and some refreshments…

## Kick-off ORCESTRA with a dry run

In eight sessions over the first weeks of 2024 a bunch of scientists across Europe and the United States met virtually. Atmospheric people faced oceanographic people, familiar faces greeted new faces, a new community was kicked-off: The ORCESTRA community.

ORCESTRA - short for Organized Convection and EarthCare Studies over the Tropical Atlantic - is the superordinate field campaign taking place over and across the Atlantic Ocean in August and September 2024. With currently two planes and one ship, measurements and analysis are undertaken to advance the understanding of tropical meteorology, atmospheric processes and air-sea interaction. Moreover, ORCESTRA contributes with an additional plane to the calibration and validation of satellite remote sensing, especially EarthCARE which shall be launched in May 2024.

Under the roof of ORCESTRA, seven sub-campaigns, three in the air, one on land and three at sea, will come together to enhance the science of tropical **m**esoscale **c**onvective **s**ystems (MCS), including the interaction of MCS with tropical waves and air-sea interaction, and the impact of MCS on climate and the Earth’s radiation budget and processes of tropical cyclogenesis. ORCESTRA built up on the [GATE](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/gate) campaign, the Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical Experiment, which happened 50 years earlier in the exact same area and did investigate the effects of smaller-scale tropical weather systems, such as cloud clusters, on larger scale motions.

During the dry run, questions regarding how to do science within technical constraints, how to adapt along the orbit of a satellite and how to coordinate across platforms were tackled. First flight patterns were simulated based on past data and satellite images, the ship track was tuned and useful data tools and data scripts were shared. 

We not only had insights into objectives of individual [sub campaigns](orcestra.md), likewise, did we learn about tools like [AERIS](https://observations.ipsl.fr/aeris/maestro/#/map), [TOOCAN](https://toocan.ipsl.fr), [MISVA](https://misva.aeris-data.fr), GOES and [pyorcestra](https://github.com/orcestra-campaign/pyorcestra) which will support us while preparing and operating the campaign.

Luckily, some doubts about coordinating across platforms were cleared up and the operation of ORCESTRA is becoming more real.

The dry run warmed us up and we are set with eagerness and enthusiasm for take-off!

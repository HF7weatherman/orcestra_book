# Blog

Welcome to our campaign blog!
Here, we share some impressions, challenges, successes and other insights apart from the measurements in the campaign. This blog tries to capture the most recent developments and updates, but a daily post is not guaranteed as the campaign progresses and the written words here represent the perspective of the writer behind.
Anyhow, we hope you enjoy reading it and get a glimpse of our day-to-day experience!

Four days until ORCESTRA

Today I went to the Ocean Science Center Mindelo (OSCM) to visit CLARINET.
OSCM is a joint initiative between the German GEOMAR and the Instituto do Mar of Cape Verde focused on long-term observations and international collaboration.

The center is located on the east side of Mindelo Bay, slightly hidden behind residential buildings. The large hall is decorated with artistic ocean impressions. 
The TROPOS colleagues have their own laboratory and operate an impressive array of instruments on the roof. Passing by the numerous solar panels at the top, the instruments have an incredible view to the harbor and ocean. Tommy (Wind lidar) and Polly (Raman lidar) are accompanied by a Microwave radiometer (HATPRO), a Sunphotometer, a Cloud radar and radiation measurements — some dusted with salty sea spray and saharan sand. They are closely collaborating with the Cape Verdean Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO), managed by the Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia e Geofisica (INMG) of Cape Verde on the hill behind the hills where they are responsible of in-situ measurements.

A newly built large platform next to the family of instruments is waiting to host a bigger cloud radar, which is still on the ship with the other containers for RV METEOR somewhere between Las Palmas and the Cape Verde Islands.  There is still no sight of the ship and the missing containers., but they are on their way at a relaxed speed of 10 knots per hours. While scientists and technicians here are conserving their energy, ready to spring into action the moment the containers arrive. Some have taken a day off and headed to the fishermans village at São Pedro to snorkel with turtles out in the sea.

Gradually, more and more people are arriving, though fewer than expected as the flight schedule is tight and some have missed their flights.
Let’s hope that RV METEOR won’t face any delays and will arrive safely tomorrow morning.

A cool sea breeze is blowing into the bay. I’m stepping out to grab some dinner. The sky is already dark and slightly cloudy. Only the electrical lights illuminate the streets, buildings, and the harbor. Maybe I’ll catch a glimpse of Polly, shining green through the sky on the east side of the bay.

Five days until ORCESTRA

Today I landed in Mindelo, Sao Vicente, Cape Verde. It was a small airport - only two planes on the air field. The landscape is hilly, very brown, a few bushes along the way, but the ocean turquoise and very clear. „Reminds me of Dune, the movie. Do you know it?“, said one colleague from the MPI of chemistry, who also landed with the same plane today. Yes, this place is the closest thing to a desert I've ever been to. The air smells slightly like dust and fumes from the vehicles… It is hot and humid. Even the locals suffer, as the temperature today is above several degrees of what they are used too.

Five days until the first research flight. And we are encountering some hiccups. The colleagues from TU Delft arrived with the other plane which landed today. Their instruments haven’t arrived yet — stuck somewhere in air freight. But we have other bits and pieces which did not arrive yet. Several shipments via air freight are stuck somewhere - not being picked up. The way by surface/ over sea is nit much easier it seems. On top, five containers - three with scientific equipment and two with provisions for the research vessel itself - were stuck on Las Palmas until today. Finally, they departed today. The timing is still tight, but they bring food (in addition to lasers) and we likely won’t leave without them. RV METEOR should arrive as planned - but the ship with the remaining containers will do a pitstop on Praia first before coming to Mindelo. It seems like a slight delay of the departure is unavoidable.

On the positive sight, work around SEA-POL progressed smoothly. The US colleagues already arrived a few days ago, eager to built and set-up the huge radar - reminding me of a big (old-fashioned) football… all white. They didn’t seem to be encountered big difficulties and were already getting into detailed work - like fastening over 600 bolts to the panels of the radar dome.

A slight wind breeze coming from the west brings coolness and ocean smell into the harbour.
It’s time to end the day with the harbour view on the hotel rooftop and some refreshments…

## Kick-off ORCESTRA with a dry run

In eight sessions over the first weeks of 2024 a bunch of scientists across Europe and the United States met virtually. Atmospheric people faced oceanographic people, familiar faces greeted new faces, a new community was kicked-off: The ORCESTRA community.

ORCESTRA - short for Organized Convection and EarthCare Studies over the Tropical Atlantic - is the superordinate field campaign taking place over and across the Atlantic Ocean in August and September 2024. With currently two planes and one ship, measurements and analysis are undertaken to advance the understanding of tropical meteorology, atmospheric processes and air-sea interaction. Moreover, ORCESTRA contributes with an additional plane to the calibration and validation of satellite remote sensing, especially EarthCARE which shall be launched in May 2024.

Under the roof of ORCESTRA, seven sub-campaigns, three in the air, one on land and three at sea, will come together to enhance the science of tropical **m**esoscale **c**onvective **s**ystems (MCS), including the interaction of MCS with tropical waves and air-sea interaction, and the impact of MCS on climate and the Earth’s radiation budget and processes of tropical cyclogenesis. ORCESTRA built up on the [GATE](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/gate) campaign, the Global Atmospheric Research Program's Atlantic Tropical Experiment, which happened 50 years earlier in the exact same area and did investigate the effects of smaller-scale tropical weather systems, such as cloud clusters, on larger scale motions.

During the dry run, questions regarding how to do science within technical constraints, how to adapt along the orbit of a satellite and how to coordinate across platforms were tackled. First flight patterns were simulated based on past data and satellite images, the ship track was tuned and useful data tools and data scripts were shared. 

We not only had insights into objectives of individual [sub campaigns](orcestra.md), likewise, did we learn about tools like [AERIS](https://observations.ipsl.fr/aeris/maestro/#/map), [TOOCAN](https://toocan.ipsl.fr), [MISVA](https://misva.aeris-data.fr), GOES and [pyorcestra](https://github.com/orcestra-campaign/pyorcestra) which will support us while preparing and operating the campaign.

Luckily, some doubts about coordinating across platforms were cleared up and the operation of ORCESTRA is becoming more real.

The dry run warmed us up and we are set with eagerness and enthusiasm for take-off!

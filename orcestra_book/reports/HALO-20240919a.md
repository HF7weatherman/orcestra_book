![track](../figures/HALO-20240919a/HALO-20240919a-track_174000UTC_withalltracks.jpeg)

Flight path superimposed on the natural color image from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16 satellite on 19th September 2024 at 17:40 UTC. The location of the aircraft at the time of the image is shown by the red arrow. The points of closest approach to the EarthCARE (green) and PACE (purple) satellite tracks are marked with red crosses. The points of closest approach to METEOR are marked with red dots. The segment of the path highlighted in orange indicates where the roll maneuver for the radar calibration took place.

## Conditions

## Execution

- Intentionally delayed take-off until 11:00 UTC (to try to prevent requiring a waiting maneuver before the satellite underpasses. In hindsight this was a slight error of judgement, see below).
- 1st meteor overpass at 12:20 UTC (10.84N, 50.20W).
- 1st circle at eastmost point (with minor detour to avoid strong convection) from 12:33 - 13:31 UTC.
- 2nd meteor overpass at 13:47 UTC (10.86N, 50.31W).
- 2nd circle from 13:56 - 14:56 UTC.
- 3rd circle at start of PACE track was reduced from radius=72 nm to radius=39 nm because otherwise we would've been about 10 minutes too late for the satellite underpasses.
- 3rd circle from 15:03 - 15:33 UTC.
- Waiting maneuver from 15:33 - 15:44 UTC. Maneuver added because the small circle made us too early for the satellite underpasses.
- PACE track from 15:44 - 16:29 UTC. Closest point to PACE at 16:23 UTC (16.16N, 53.37W) with 64m error.
- 4th circle from 16:29 - 17:26 UTC.
- EarthCARE track from 17:26 - 18:04 UTC. Miscommunication meant we initially followed the previous day's EarthCARE track forecast and so were 400m east of EarthCARE. We corrected this by 17:37 UTC. Closest point to EarthCARE at 17:44 UTC (14.53N, 53.88W) with 4m error.
- Radar calibration (roll maneuver) at end of the EarthCARE track from 17:59 - 18:01 UTC
- 5th circle center moved eastwards to start at end of EarthCARE track and thereby be closer to the smaller-than-anticipated 3rd circle.
- 5th circle from 18:04 - 19:04 UTC.
- Landing descent started at 19:24 UTC; landed at 20:00 UTC.

## Crew

## Track
![track](../figures/HALO-20240818a/HALO-20240818a-track.jpeg)

## Conditions

ITCZ very broad, thought of development on northern Edge
Northward development just south of Cape Verde
Convection covered mostly in center of domain
Decaying convective complex on way home active mid level convection at FL300
Convection at all levels, very thick cirrus layer
thin cirrus and banded cloud heaps to south
statigraphy to the north
nowhere very dry
Cloudtops below FL450 (Mostly) 



## Execution

lots of demands
late takeoff
adjustment for EC (smaller circles, cut edges)
center north from south
FMS problems causing to wander off circle. 
coordination (shifht circle and line ... new circle pattern)
    - change of altitude for circle
    - change of circle
    - change of circle pattern
coordination with Meteor/simultenaity with EC.

## Impressions

The large convective system in the center of the ITCZ did not reveal any structure since it was topped by a more or less homogeneous optically thick cirrus layer. North and South of this line we observed shallow clouds, covering everything from cloudless to stratocumulus. 

 - 10:06 Takeoff 
 - 10:34 Some cirrus above and at flight level
 - 10:36 Flying along the ITCZ; deep convection to the South, shallow clouds North
 - 10:48 Only few shallow clouds to the North, even cloudless patches
 - 10:58 Turning into EC track; decided to shift first circle Southward by one degree: center at N12° 00.00’, W28° 43.08’ 
 - 11:23 Entering Northern circle counterclockwise from the South; right at the edge of the convective system to the right; broken clouds, cloudless, stratocumulus in the circle
 - 11:31 Isolated white-dragon-like convective cloud to the right
 - 12:23 Leaving circle, entering anvil cirrus of deep convective system 
 - 12:30 gap in the clouds; ocean visible; approaching next anvil
 - 12:39 diving into cirrus 
 - 13:00 finally above cirrus again
 - 13:13 convective towers visible underneath
 - 13:27 another anvil edge
 - 14:02 Leaving deep convective region; shallow clouds below cirrus; flying mostly along top of cirrus layer
 - 14:18 leaving convective system and reaching area of South circle; entering Southern circle from the South, clockwise; mostly low clouds visible; optically thin cirrus layer above, only identified by looking towards the horizon; cirrus thickening to the East
 - 15:43 Distinct cloud lines 
 - 16:00 Entering deep convective region again
 - 16:04 EarthCARE overpass above deep convective system
 - 16:26 Some small overshooting tops to the right
 - 16:35 27 NM circle; some convective tops visible through/above cirrus
 - 16:57 Heading towards 2nd 40 NM circle; more convective structure visible; afterwards back to EC track and heading towards SAL
 - 19:10 Landing 

```{note}
Co-location with ATR and EarthCARE over an aerosol layer near SAL. Spectacular line of convection on southern edge toward the west.

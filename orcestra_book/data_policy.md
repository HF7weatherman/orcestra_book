# Data Policy

ORCESTRA encourages free use and access to data. We trust in the integrity of the scientific community to honor the contributions of those who collected these data.

The ORCESTRA data are a product of the collective efforts and funding of various independent research groups. It often represents years of work in developing, certifying, and operating instruments, often tied to specific research or Ph.D. projects. We ask users to respect the priority of the data collectors by coordinating use with the instrument Principal Investigators (PIs) and by clearly acknowledging the source of the data in any publications or presentations.

For publications using ORCESTRA data, please include this acknowledgement:

> "The data used in this publication was collected during the ORCESTRA field campaign and is available through [insert institute name]. ORCESTRA is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Max Planck Society (MPG), the German Research Foundation (DFG), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR)."

This approach ensures the recognition and respect for the significant efforts behind the data collection while promoting its open and respectful use.

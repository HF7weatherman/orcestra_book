# ORCESTRA overview

**Organized Convection and EarthCare Studies over the Tropical Atlantic**

The overarching objective of ORCESTRA is to better understand the physical mechanisms that organize tropical convection at the mesoscale, including the interaction of convective organization with tropical waves and air-sea interaction, and the impact of convective organization on climate and the Earthâ€™s radiation budget and processes of tropical cyclogenesis. In addition to advancing understanding of tropical meteorology and atmospheric processes, ORCESTRA observations will to help calibrate and validate satellite remote sensing (especially EarthCARE) and a new generation of global ocean-eddy and storm-resolving climate models.

## Sub-campaigns in ORCESTRA

ORCESTRA unites several sub-campaigns under its roof. The detailed scientific objectives of the sub-campaigns can be found on subpages respectively.
The campaign took place on the Cape Verde Islands, Barbados and all across the Atlantic Ocean from 10 August to 30 September, 2024.

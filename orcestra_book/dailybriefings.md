# Daily briefings

## ORCESTRA-20240812

### Flight updates

**ATR flight 11 August**

- Follow flight plan and met EarthCare
- Worked well, some data loss for two ladars
- Conditions very dirty, stronger wind than the day before, flew over some precipitating clouds
- Next flights on the 13th, two flights, one with EarthCare, one with HALO

**HALO flight 11 August**

- Flight plan worked well, also the position of the 3 circles, instruments worked very well in general
- More intense convecton on the northern band, interesting vertical moisture profile in and out of ITCZ
- Flying around cloud top, great overpass with EarthCare for the radar, not so useful for the lidar (saturated)

**ATR and HALO 12 August**

- No flight today

**EarthCare**

- Will do manoeuvres after the 20th August, should communicate with them flight planning

### Status updates

**BowTIE**

- Containers still on Prahia
- Ship won't leave on Tuesday
- Still trying to figure out permit for launching sondes

### Weather briefing

**MAESTRO**
* Yesterday's weather
    * Behind easterly wave, dry weather, next (strong) wave Thursday/Friday
    * 400-m cloud base, broken stratocumulus
    * Saharian dust layer

* Forecast for August 13
    * Decrease of the strength of the African easterly jet
    * Low wind speed
    * Very shallow convection
    * AROME forecast a little bit of rain, but probably nothing
    * Base cloud 300m, cloud top 700 m
    * PW 46 mm Tuesday, 36 mm Wednesday


**PERCUSION**

## ORCESTRA-20240811

### Flight updates

**ATR flight 10 August**
 
Flight towards Mindelo following typical MAESTRO flight pattern. VAD scan, track between CVAtmosphericObservatory and Meteor. Everything went well, Saharan Air Layer, small stratocumuli.

**HALO flight 11 August**

- Take-off at 11 LT
- [Statistical flight pattern](plans/HALO-20240811a)

**ATR flight 11 August**

- Take-off 14.30 LT
- [EarthCare flight pattern](plans/ATR-20240811a)

**Platform coordination** 

- HALO circle above ATR at the end of HALO flight.

### Status updates

- EarthCARE: all instruments running, perfect timing for the campaign
- CLARINET: still waiting for Radar
- BOWTIE: trying to get permit to launch radiosondes in port
- Radiosondes on Cape Verde: 
    - Initial problems with signal lost in the lower troposphere solved
    - regular launches running. Last sonde (4th sounding that worked well): cloud base at 400m, 900m thick stratocumulus, 30% RH in the free troposphere. 
    - 6 sondes will be launched today

### Weather briefing

**MAESTRO**
- Observations of yesterday:
    - Radiosondes: atrong inversion near 2km
    - AROME successfully predicted arrival of stratocumulus layer and observed LCL at Sal. Also precipitatble water well predicted
- Forecast for today: 
    - pronounced 700hPa easterly wind (easterly jet)
    - weaker low-level wind 
    - subsidence at 500hPa over Sal
    - No rain expected over Sal and to the north. ITCZ well to the South
    - Stratocumulus start to break up in the afternoon

**PERCUSION** 

PERCUSION forecasts are available at [weather.orcestra-campaign.org.](https://weather.orcestra-campaign.org/briefings/20240811/main.html)

- Current synoptic situation: tropical wave passed around 0 UTC, now more humid air from the South
- Today no extensive low-wind speed events / doldrums
- Next flight day (tuesday): ITCZ near Sal, EC track also close to Sal. Upstream the next easterly wave, so maybe mostly clear-sky conditions.

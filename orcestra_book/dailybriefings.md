**HALO [past, Tuesday]**

* Most dropsonde launches detected. Good coordination with ATR.

**ATR [upcoming]**
* Today at 15.15 LT: Typical MAESTRO flight with SAR overpass
* Tomorrow: Two flights, second one coordinated with HALO

**HALO [upcoming]**
* Tomorrow 10.15

**KING Air [today]**
* Flying today to the west, take off at 12.15

### Status updates

**Meteor:**
* Containers arrived, Raman lidar being setup. Expected departure tonight.

**Radiosondes:**
* Successful launches from the beach side.

### Weather briefing

**MAESTRO**

* Yesterdays sounding: dry with low cloud base & strong African easterly jet
* Forecast evaluation: AROME represented clear-sky conditions very well. PW strongly increases, from 35 to 58 until tomorrow
* Forecast: African Easterly wave arriving. weakening easterlies and turning to southerlies on 17th. Today some rising motion to the east. Tomorrow deeper convection, 17th passage of deep systems in the south. From tomorrow noon to Saturday noon deeper convection and precipitation expected. Cloud base near 300m and top at 500-1000m.

**PERCUSION**

PERCUSION forecasts are available at [weather.orcestra-campaign.org](https://weather.orcestra-campaign.org/briefings/20240815/main.html)
* TC Ernesto now a hurrican
* New wave reaching us soon.
* Forecast:
    * Today: broad moist margin to the east, but SAL still dry
    * Tomorrow: original circles one degree off (should be moved 1ยบ to the South.). ATR circle well placed. Sal inside moiste margins, cloud tops up to 12km and intensifying precipitation.
    * Sunday: intense low-wind speed regions to the South that could be sampled by HALO. Northern most circle might be inside the moist margin though. Difficulty due to wave position being still uncertain.
    * Dust: today 12 UTC strong dust event. With approaching wave the dust might be coiled up around Sal.

## ORCESTRA-20240812

### Flight updates

**ATR flight 11 August**

- Follow flight plan and met EarthCare
- Worked well, some data loss for two ladars
- Conditions very dirty, stronger wind than the day before, flew over some precipitating clouds
- Next flights on the 13th, two flights, one with EarthCare, one with HALO

**HALO flight 11 August**

- Flight plan worked well, also the position of the 3 circles, instruments worked very well in general
- More intense convecton on the northern band, interesting vertical moisture profile in and out of ITCZ
- Flying around cloud top, great overpass with EarthCare for the radar, not so useful for the lidar (saturated)

**ATR and HALO 12 August**

- No flight today

**EarthCare**

- Will do manoeuvres after the 20th August, should communicate with them flight planning

### Status updates

**BowTIE**

- Containers still on Prahia
- Ship won't leave on Tuesday
- Still trying to figure out permit for launching sondes

### Weather briefing

**MAESTRO**
* Yesterday's weather
    * Behind easterly wave, dry weather, next (strong) wave Thursday/Friday
    * 400-m cloud base, broken stratocumulus
    * Saharian dust layer

* Forecast for August 13
    * Decrease of the strength of the African easterly jet
    * Low wind speed
    * Very shallow convection
    * AROME forecast a little bit of rain, but probably nothing
    * Base cloud 300m, cloud top 700 m
    * PW 46 mm Tuesday, 36 mm Wednesday


**PERCUSION**

PERCUSION forecasts are available at [weather.orcestra-campaign.org](https://weather.orcestra-campaign.org/briefings/20240812/main.html)
* Possibility of sampling the doldrum on the northern circle

## ORCESTRA-20240811

### Flight updates

**ATR flight 10 August**
 
Flight towards Mindelo following typical MAESTRO flight pattern. VAD scan, track between CVAtmosphericObservatory and Meteor. Everything went well, Saharan Air Layer, small stratocumuli.

**HALO flight 11 August**

- Take-off at 11 LT
- [Statistical flight pattern](plans/HALO-20240811a)

**ATR flight 11 August**

- Take-off 14.30 LT
- [EarthCare flight pattern](plans/ATR-20240811a)

**Platform coordination** 

- HALO circle above ATR at the end of HALO flight.

### Status updates

- EarthCARE: all instruments running, perfect timing for the campaign
- CLARINET: still waiting for Radar
- BOWTIE: trying to get permit to launch radiosondes in port
- Radiosondes on Cape Verde: 
    - Initial problems with signal lost in the lower troposphere solved
    - regular launches running. Last sonde (4th sounding that worked well): cloud base at 400m, 900m thick stratocumulus, 30% RH in the free troposphere. 
    - 6 sondes will be launched today

### Weather briefing

**MAESTRO**
- Observations of yesterday:
    - Radiosondes: atrong inversion near 2km
    - AROME successfully predicted arrival of stratocumulus layer and observed LCL at Sal. Also precipitatble water well predicted
- Forecast for today: 
    - pronounced 700hPa easterly wind (easterly jet)
    - weaker low-level wind 
    - subsidence at 500hPa over Sal
    - No rain expected over Sal and to the north. ITCZ well to the South
    - Stratocumulus start to break up in the afternoon

**PERCUSION** 

PERCUSION forecasts are available at [weather.orcestra-campaign.org.](https://weather.orcestra-campaign.org/briefings/20240811/main.html)

- Current synoptic situation: tropical wave passed around 0 UTC, now more humid air from the South
- Today no extensive low-wind speed events / doldrums
- Next flight day (tuesday): ITCZ near Sal, EC track also close to Sal. Upstream the next easterly wave, so maybe mostly clear-sky conditions.

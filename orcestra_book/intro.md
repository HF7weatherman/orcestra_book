# The ORCESTRA campaign

**ORCESTRA - Organized Convection and EarthCare Studies over the Tropical Atlantic**


The overall objectives of the ORCESTRA campaign are summarised as followed:

```{note}
1. Determine the drivers of mesoscale organisation in the tropics and their impact on smallscale weather systems and the large scale circulation with a particular focus on the structure and variability of the Atlantic ITCZ
2. Serve as a benchmark for satellite remote sensing and a new generation of high resolution storm resolving models
```

ORCESTRA is an international initiative that combines eight different sub-campaigns:
* [BOW-TIE - Beobachtung von Ozean und Wolken â€“ Das Trans ITCZ Experiment](bowtie.md)
* [CELLO - Cloud and EarthCARE caL/vaL Observations](cello.md)
* [CLARINET - Cloud and Aerosol Remote sensing for EarthCARE](clarinet.md)
* [MAESTRO - Mesoscale organisation of tropical convection](maestro.md)
* [PERCUSION - Persistent EarthCARE underflight studies of the ITCZ and organized convection](percusion.md)
* [PICCOLO - Process Investigation of Clouds and Convective Organization over the atLantic Ocean](piccolo.md)
* [SCORE - Sub-Cloud Observations of Rain Evaporation](score.md)
* [STRINQS - Soundings and turbulent eddy measurements in the ITCZ with a network of quadcopters](strinqs.md)


## Date and location

ORCESTRA will happen in August and September 2024 in the tropical Atlantic region.

Further details can be found on the [ORCESTRA overview](orcestra.md) page. This book further includes information on the science, the (measurement) strategy, preparations (e.g. the virtual field campaign), and soonish also everything around data including a data concept, data policy, data access and description.

* Departure
* Climb FL180
* Aim between RV Meteor (in Mindelo port) and Mindelo Observatory
* Leg H1 WP1-WP2 FL180
* Continue a few km for VAD clockwise rotation (stay > 1km from WP2)
* Return towards WP1 at FL180
* After leaving the island, descend to the cloud base (~3000 ft) continue to WP1
* Redo the landing at the base (~3000 ft) from WP1 to WP2 (stop before the island)
* Descend to 500 ft
* Return landing towards WP1 at 500 ft, with a portion at 60 m /ground on part of this landing

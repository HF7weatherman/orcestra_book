* After takeoff, fly to EarthCARE track (*north*)
* Fly along EarthCARE track to southern turning point (*south*)
* Fly north to southernmost circle (center at *edge_south*, 1 h, 12 sondes, enter circle at southern edge of circle and fly clockwise)
* Return to EarthCARE track; EarthCARE overpass during straight leg between south and center circle 
* Fly to center circle (center at *center*, 1 h, 12 sondes, enter circle at northern edge of circle and fly clockwise)
* Return to EarthCARE track and fly to northernmost circle (center at *edge_north*, 1 h, 12 sondes, enter circle at southern edge of circle and fly clockwise)
* Return to EarthCARE track and fly to *north*
* Return to Sal

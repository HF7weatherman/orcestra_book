**CLoud and Aerosol Remote sensing for EarThcare**

*Lead PIs: Dr. Annett Skupin and Dr. Holger Baars (Tropos)*

Since 2021, TROPOS it operating a growing ACTRIS remote sensing facility at the Ocean Science Center Mindelo (OSCM). The station is part of TROPOS' ACTRIS-D national facility CVAO (Cabo Verde Atmospheric Observatory) and part of ATMO ACCESS.
So far, the station comprises a complete aerosol and cloud remote sensing set up:
-	A 15-channel multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar of type PollyXT (TROPOS development) for measuring aerosol, cloud and water vapour profiles. polly.tropos.de
-	An [AERONET](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/) sun-sky-lunar photometer (CIMEL). 
-	A RPG HATRPO G5 microwave radiometer
-	A cloud profiling radar
-	A HALO photonics streamline XR scanning Doppler lidar
_	And a BSRN-like radiation station

In the framework of CLARINET, cloud radar observations will be extended to dual frequency by operating a MIRA 35 Ghz (Metek) and a RPG 94 Ghz cloud radar during August/September 2024.
Furthermore, optimized and tailored operations and data analysis will be conducted to support the other ORCESTRA campaigns and to validate EarthCARE measurements. Additionally, the representativeness of the station in the context of regional heterogeneity of aerosols, clouds, and water vapor will be investigated. This will help contextualize the long-term observations planned for the next 25+ years at OSCM, as well as the intensive operations carried out during ORCESTRA in the summer of 2024.
